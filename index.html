            “The purpose of education is not creating solutions, but creating movement in education in which people develop their own solutions with external support based on the 
            personalized curriculum.“Ken Robinson, Internationally Acclaimed Expert on Creativity and InnovationEducation was and still continues to be the mediator to a better 
            life: wealth, equality, humanity, and peace. Achieving education is believed to promote integration and emancipation, end discrimination and prejudice, and solve the
            challenges of the future.However, the current political, economic and social developments of the world have proven that current education is not powerful enough to 
            guarantee the happiness for all and every one of us. Moreover, the education system itself has been constantly changing.  Educational institutions found themselves 
            in permanent reforms trying to catch up with the rapidly changing world.In educational circles, some question the relevance of current approaches. When the internet
            offers information at the click of a mouse, what's the point of education and pedagogy? Under the pressure of maintaining high performance, education has been reduced
            to securing tested skills as an end in itself. Education is no longer for the purpose of developing a vision of ourselves and of the society we would like to live in.
            To redress the balance a bit, this Summer School proposes a vision of education capable of promoting young people's distinctive powers of thought and action, a platform
            for a robust exchange of views on some of the biggest issues (e.g. How to effectively help those most vulnerable.) facing our world at a time when it is desperately
            needed.The sessions will enable students to learn key concepts and issues surrounding the educational topics and give them a broad and international perspective on
            education.   The Summer School builds upon robust continental European intellectual traditions of encouraging young people to espouse ideas and embrace their role 
            as public intellectuals.

            <p>Dear Students ,it is difficult to see an unambiguous goal of learning in the current world, because there are no objective indicators of successful academic achievement
                related to the success of professional career, wealth and happiness. The purpose of it is hidden in ourselves; in the development of our personal abilities. What can
                one gain from the process of learning is very much related to the personal capabilities to utilize the information for the good of oneself.I have been trying to pose 
                and answer questions as to what could be the efficient teaching strategies for children and adults, why some of the young people opt out of the education, how to bring
                them back, what are the important educational topics for the current world, how to promote social, emotional learning, and collaboration, how to relate creativity to the
                 educational experience, how to fascinate children by learning, how to learn by exploring the world around us and relating it to our own selves…These and many other 
                  questions we will have to answer while searching for the future educational strategies, which will support mutual respect, cooperation, leadership, personal integrity,
                values of diversity and conflict resolution.
